homework assignment to generate a random password
Homework-03 info:

This is my assignment for the third homework. It should prompt you for a character length that you would want you password to be. Then it will take the user to the main password generator screen in which the user can input the parameter they'd like for the random password to generate. Clicking on the generate button will produce a random password with all the set parameters specified by the user.

I have a couple changes that I made that may differ from if the criteria set from the assignment (but should still fulfill it):

*******HTML:
-Added a small form in the provided HTML in order to collect user info about the criteria for their password
-It should ask user for character length, as well as if they would like to have any letters or special characters (check if they want to apply)

*******CSS:
-No changes were made.

*******Javascript:
-There are two js files listed in the repository.
-The first one does not actually do anything and isn't connected to the HTML page in anyway. I essentially used it as a scratch page and left it so you can see my thought process.
-The second js file, "script2.js" is the main and only js file being used. Please look at that to see the final edit of my script. Also, I was thrown off by the pre-provided code. Essentially started my js code from pure scratch (less confusion on my part).
